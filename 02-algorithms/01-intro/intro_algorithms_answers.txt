Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life. 

1. Pseudocode for Feeding cat

  If no food in pantry
    (Drive to store && Buy cat food) or (don’t get sleep)
   Else
     Open(can)
     Dump(can, clean bowl)
     Command_cat_to_sit
     If cat sits
       Place bowl in cat tray
     Else
       Recursive: Command_cat_to_sit
     End If
  End If
End program

2  Pseudocode For Warming Car for trip

  Locate remote starter for car
  Press-button (style=briefly, times=2)
  If fob glows
     (car started)
  Else
    Recursive: Press-button(briefly,2)
  End If
End program

3.  whiskey-tasting
  Define rating [1..10]
  Define location = “front”
  Define whiskey_stock hash (name: [age, rating, location]) 
  For each whiskey
    pour_whiskey(name)
    Get rating
    store whiskey(name: rating)
    If rating greater than 7
      Assign “back” to location
    Else if rating greater than 4
      Assign “middle” to location
    else
      Assign “Front” to location
     End If
  End for loop
End program
