1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life.
   1)  baking rum cake
         prepare mise-en-place
           check_available_amount( each ingredient)
             if not available
                 choose another recipe(break, end program)
              if available
                 measure_into_separate_bowls (ingredient)
         turn on oven and set_temp(325F)
         locate pan(type = bundt, size = 11")
         add and whisk (dry ingredients, large bowl)
         add and whisk (wet ingredients, medium bowl)
         add and whisk (dry ingredients, medium bowl)
         add wet mixturet to dry mixture
         stir (10 strokes)
          while dry ingredientsi NOT incorporated?
            stir (10 strokes)
         fill pans (method= scoop, pan= prepared pan, fill_level=3/4)
         bake (method- insert into oven, pan = filled pan, duration = 25-30 minutes)
           check_doneness(toothpick, filled_pan)
             done?
                remove (pan, oven, cooling rack)
             not done?
                continue baking (pan, oven)
                set timer (5 minutes)minutes
                loop back to check doneness
        cool(rack, time=10 minutes)

   2)   going for hike on Appalachian Trail
          is check_weather_forecast == suitable and spare_time == time_required_for_hike
             no
                choose another activity(break, end program)
             yes
                prepare for hike
                  choose clothes to match weather conditions (separate module!)
                  change clothes to weather appropriate outdoor wear [pants, shirt, jacket, socks, hiking boots, hat]
                  locate daypack
                  check contents [house_keys, first_aid_kit, compass, map, flashlight, bear spray, emergency kit, water_bottle]
                  fill water bottle (bottle, water)
                  plan route to meet time allowed (gps, time, fitness)
             don daypack(daypack)
             grab phone and portable gps (phone, gps)
             feed cat (call separate module)
             walk outside
             lock door(keys)
             turn (right at end of driveway)
             walk (1/4 mile)

 3)  feed cat
       if cat_food == in_pantry?
        false
          go to store and buy some or you won't get any sleep tonight
        true
          select (can from pantry)
          open (can)
          dump (can, clean cat bowl)
          command_cat (sit)
          place (bowl, tray)
          rinse (empty_can)
          toss (empty_can, garbage_bin)
          if cat = doesn't eat
             curse (spoiled_cat)
          else
             feel_blessed
      end
