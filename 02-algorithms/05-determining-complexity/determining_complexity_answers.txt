What's the Big-O of the following algorithms.
Show work and reasoning.

1.goodbye_world.rb
   def goodbye_world(n)
     puts "Goodbye World! #{n}"
   end

O(1) = Constant time to complete, no matter what n happens to be.

2.find_largest.rb
    def find_largest(collection)
      largest = collection[0]
      collection.length.times do |i|
      if collection[i] >= largest
        largest = collection[i]
      end
    end
    largest
  end

O(n) = Linear complexity. The entire array would need to be searched  dependent on size, n.

3. find_largest_2D_array.rb
   def find_largest(collection)
     largest = collection[0][0]
      collection.length.times do |i|
        subcollection = collection[i]
        subcollection.length.times do |i|
          if subcollection[i] >= largest
            largest = subcollection[i]
          end
        end
      end
    largest
   end

O(n^2)   Quadratic because there are two for loops that enumerate all pairs of positions.
Horrible way to go thru a 2D collection, a binary search  would reduce it to O(n logn) .

4. numbers_recursive.rb
   def numbers(n)
     if (n == 0)
       return 0
     elsif (n == 1)
       return 1
     else
       return numbers(n-1) + numbers(n-2)
     end
   end

O(2^n). Exponential Complexity As n increases in size the number of operations increase exponentially
because each increase in n acts like an additional layer.

5. numbers_iterative.rb
   def iterative(n)
     num1 = 0
     num2 = 1

     i = 0
     while i < n-1
       tmp = num1 + num2
       num1 = num2
       num2 = tmp
       i+=1
     end

    num2
  end

O(n) Linear, it completes at n-1, dependent directly on size of n.

6.
sort.rb
def sort(collection, from=0, to=nil)
 if to == nil
   # Sort the whole collection, by default
   to = collection.count - 1
 end

 if from >= to
   # Done sorting
   return
 end

 # Take a pivot value, at the far left
 pivot = collection[from]

 # Min and Max pointers
 min = from
 max = to

 # Current free slot
 free = min

 while min < max
   if free == min # Evaluate collection[max]
     if collection[max] <= pivot # Smaller than pivot, must move
       collection[free] = collection[max]
       min += 1
       free = max
     else
       max -= 1
     end
   elsif free == max # Evaluate collection[min]
     if collection[min] >= pivot # Bigger than pivot, must move
       collection[free] = collection[min]
       max -= 1
       free = min
     else
       min += 1
     end
   else
     raise "Inconsistent state"
   end
 end

 collection[free] = pivot

 sort collection, from, free - 1
 sort collection, free + 1, to

 collection
end

0(n^2) Quadratic complexity. A quicksort with recursions.
The target element could be the last element on either side of the pivot.
